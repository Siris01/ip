  <h2 class="big-text">Call for Papers</h2>
  <p class="main-body">We invite high-quality submissions describing original and unpublished work for the conference.
    At least one author should register for the conference. Though the theme of this conference is Computational
    Intelligence in Data Science and Knowledge Management we also solicit papers from cutting edge technologies like
    IoT, Cyber Security and Software Defined Networks. Machine learning deliver insights hidden in data for rapid,
    automated responses and improved decision making. Machine learning for IoT can be used to project future trends,
    detect anomalies, and augment intelligence by ingesting image, video and audio. Edge computing allows the deployment
    of light weight devices to process data collected from IoT sensors. Machine learning aids cyber security systems to
    analyze patterns and helps to adapt the dynamic behavior to defend against attacks. Modern networking paradigms like
    Software Defined Networking allows high degree of programmability by decoupling control plane from the data plane.
    Cyber security can be measured under 5 themes - firewalls, secure configuration, user access control, malware
    protection and patch management.
    Accepted papers that are presented at the conference will be published in the Scopus Indexed Springer IFIP AICT
    (Advances in Information and Communication Technology) series.
    Each paper will receive at least three reviews. At least one author of each accepted paper must register by the
    early registration date indicated on the conference website and present the paper.</p>
